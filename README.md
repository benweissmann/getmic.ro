The fastest way to install [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/)

`curl https://getmic.ro | bash`

This script will install micro to the directory you're in. To install somewhere else (e.g. /usr/local/bin), cd there and make sure you can write to that directory, e.g. `cd /usr/local/bin; curl https://getmic.ro | sudo bash`

## Advanced usage

There's a couple other things you can do with getmic.ro.

### Use another POSIX shell

While getmic.ro is tested primarily with bash, it should be compatible with any POSIX shell (we test zsh, dash, ksh, and busybox). If you don't have `bash`, you can just use:

`curl https://getmic.ro | sh`

### Verify the script checksum

To verify the script, you can download it and checksum it. The sha256 checksum is `03209db252d312323c3980490860f96f0b8ffba4c0d955bce793da60098ea210`.

    curl -o getmicro.sh https://getmic.ro
    shasum -a 256 getmicro.sh # and check the output
    bash getmicro.sh

## Contributing

Thank you for contributing! We use the Github pull request workflow: fork this repo, make your changes, and then submit a pull request. There's a couple things you'll need to do to get your PR merged:

- Make sure all of the tests pass. Github Actions will report test failures on the PR page once you open it.

- If you introduce new behavior, update the Github Actions tests (in [`.github/workflows/test.yml`](https://github.com/benweissmann/getmic.ro/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml)) to test that behavior.

- If you introduce new user-facing options or behavior, update this README to document that behavior.

If you're not sure how to do any of these things, feel free to open a PR with your work-in-progress and whatever questions you have!
